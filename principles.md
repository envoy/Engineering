# Engineering Principles
This document describes the kind of engineering team we are, and in some cases aspire to be.

It’s important to write it down so we can achieve & perpetuate it.  We do this by using it as the basis for:
* Hiring.  Job descriptions & bands, crafting of our interview process.
* Individual growth & feedback.  Job bands & discussions about opportunities.
* Team growth & improvement.  Goals, KPIs, and associated projects, ceremonies, and time allocation.

Tactically, it can & maybe should cover:
* Best attributes & behaviors.  E.g., we geek about new technologies and generally, learning things
* Habits & general best practices  E.g., we own it in production and ensure we have ways to see if it’s working
* Goals & high level time allocation  E.g., we make time for quality and use that time to do proactive things like clean up code, write tests
* Desired results  E.g., we’re seen as one of the top engineering teams by folks outside Envoy

## Our principles:

* [We maintain high standards](#1)
* [We take pride in doing things right](#2)
* [We act like owners and keep context](#3)
* [We lift each other up](#4)
* [We’re High I/O](#5)
* [We continuously get better](#6)

### We maintain high standards
* We know perfect is the enemy of good, but we aspire for great.
* We keep things small and simple.  One layer of the onion at a time.  Commits, PRs, tickets, communication.
* Moving fast and decisively helps us deliver value, learn and improve, and achieve quality faster.
* We embrace that change is constant.  The industry, technology, our customers, our business, and our team will change and as such, our code will and should change.
* We build durable habits and practices.

### We take pride in doing things right
* We feel personally accountable and responsible for the health of our product, code, and systems.
* We make doing the right thing to do easy to do, and invest the time to do it.  E.g., taco, great tests, guilds.
* We leave code better than when we found it
* We care about standards and tech debt, and push back when we need to
* We automate repeatable tasks
* Features are not done until they have long term support (runbook, logging, metrics)
* We deeply understand the importance of creating proper tests

### We act like owners and keep context
* We love engineering and technology, but we solve for our customers and the bigger teams 1st.
* If we can’t unanimously articulate why we’re doing something, we don’t do it.
* We solve problems we actually have before ones we might.
* We use data to tell us the story.  If we don’t have data, we prioritize getting it.
* We make decisions as a group after informed discussion. Decisions are not dictated from the top, or from the person making the loudest noises, rather they’re based on merit, options, and criteria.
* We look for problems and inefficiencies and find elegant solutions before they become major issues.
* We act with appropriate urgency when the situation calls for it.

### We lift each other up
* We’re happy when helping others succeed. We prioritize pushing, helping, and teaching each other.
* We make sure everyone has a voice.  We crave diversity of experiences, backgrounds, opinions, ideas, and locations and feel uneasy without it.
* We keep things rational, objective, and shared.
* We work together toward shared goals
* We start with trust in each other and build from there.  We assume good intent and skill 1st.
* We’re humble.  None of us is as smart as all of us.

<a name="5"></a>
### We’re High I/O
* We overcommunicate.  Our PRs, tickets, docs, code, emails, etc. all have enough context to help the reader.
* We ask and listen 1st
* We track and share our work early and often, in service of others

<a name="6"></a>
### We continuously get better
* We live to learn new things and constantly improve our craft, like staying up to date on new technologies, tools, and techniques.
* We’re inspired by what's possible as well as what people inside and outside Envoy know, and eager to incorporate the best.  We use and contribute to open source, for example.
* We try things then learn from them and iterate.  Retrospectives > postmortems.
* We learn by doing, more so than talking
* We encourage cross-pollination of work so we don’t establish gatekeepers of work.
* We aim to not be bored, because we know we’re at our best when we’re not.
* We love and seek feedback.  PRs, data, tests, asking people….it’s all good.
